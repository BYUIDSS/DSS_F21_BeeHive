# Beehive Project Outline

## Project Description
Beehive Credit Union is to open a new location in Idaho Falls, and needs to decide which region of Idaho Falls (NE or SE) to build a new branch in. They are deciding based on the current population, number of church members, population growth, church population growth, and car traffic which region to build in. In essence, they are asking which region has more current and especially future potential. We can also extend this to other regions if possible.
